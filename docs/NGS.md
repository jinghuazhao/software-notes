Note that it is easier to implement with ```prefetch``` as shown below.

## Alignment and variant calling tutorial

See https://github.com/ekg/alignment-and-variant-calling-tutorial. Note that E.coli_K12_MG1655.fa is unavailable any more, instead we have to download it directly from NCBI, 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/556503834, choose FASTA (text), to reach https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_000913.3?report=fasta&log$=seqview&format=text and save
to a local file, whose empty lines have to be removed, see them with awk '(length($NF)==0){print NR}' E.coli_K12_MG1655.fa.

The fastq-dump generates .fa files, which need to be compressed with gzip.

## GSNAP, MapSplice, RUM, STAR, RNA-seq pipeline

```bash
# gsnap
wget http://research-pub.gene.com/gmap/src/gmap-gsnap-2018-07-04.tar.gz
tar xfz gmap-gsnap-2018-07-04.tar.gz
cd gmap-2018-07-04

cd STAR/source
make
```
See [https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Bio-RNASeq](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Bio-RNASeq) for RNA-seq pipeline.

## Mendelian RNA-seq

[https://github.com/komalsrathi/MendelianRNA-seq](https://github.com/komalsrathi/MendelianRNA-seq)

The relevant installations:

```
conda create --name mendelian-rnaseq-env
source activate mendelian-rnaseq-env
conda install -c bioconda snakemake
conda install -c bioconda rna-seqc
conda install -c bioconda gatk
conda install -c biobuilds plink
conda install -c bioconda star
conda install -c bioconda picard
conda install -c bioconda bwa
conda install -c anaconda colorama
conda install -c bioconda misopy
```

## sra-toolkit, tophat

These are very straightforward, e.g.,
```bash
prefetch -v SRR3534842
fastq-dump --split-files --gzip SRR3534842
```
the SRR3534842.sra from prefetch is actually at $HOME/ncbi/public/sra which is split into `SRR3534842_1.fastq.gz`, `SRR3534842_2.fastq.gz` at the current directory. See https://www.biostars.org/p/111040/. However, the location may not desirable since it may create a huge .vdi files with VirtualBox -- to get around we do this
```bash
cd $HOME
mkdir -p /home/jhz22/D/work/ncbi/public/sra
ln -sf /home/jhz22/D/work/ncbi
```
where D is actually a shared folder at Windows.

To run ```tophat```, see [https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/tutorial.shtml](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/tutorial.shtml)
```bash
wget https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/downloads/test_data.tar.gz
tar xvfz test_data.tar.gz
cd test_data
tophat -r 20 test_ref reads_1.fq reads_2.fq
```

# Software

## adVNTR

It is a tool for genotyping Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTR) from sequence data, https://github.com/mehrdadbakhtiari/adVNTR.

## ANGSD

ANGSD is a software for analyzing next generation sequencing data, http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/ANGSD. It is relatively straightforward with GitHub; after
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ANGSD/angsd
cd angsd
make
```
but the following change is needed on line 468 of `misc/msHOT2glf.c`: `tmppch` as in (tmppch=='\0') should be `*tmppch` as in `(*tmppch==''0')`, suggested by the compiler.

## Ubuntu archive: bamtools, bcftools, bedops, bedtools, blast (ncbi-blast+), bowtie2, fastqc, fastx-toolkit, freebayes, hmmer, hisat2, picard-tools, rsem, sambamba, samtools, seqtk, sra-toolkit, subread, tophat, trinityrnaseq, vcftool, vowpal-wabbit

Install with ```sudo apt install```.

See also [https://github.com/lh3/seqtk](https://github.com/lh3/seqtk).

Besides notes above, this is also possible:
## bcftools
```bash
wget https://github.com/samtools/bcftools/releases/download/1.9/bcftools-1.9.tar.bz2
tar jfx bcftools-1.9.tar.bz2
cd bcftools-1.9
./configure --prefix=$HPC_WORK
make
make install
```
It is necessary to set the environment variables to enable plugins, so we could generate a version at $HPC_WORK/bin instead,
```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

export BCFTOOLS_PLUGINS=$HPC_WORK/bcftools-1.9/plugins
$HPC_WORK/bcftools-1.9/bcftools "$@"
```
We invoke `bcftools +check_ploidy my.vcf.gz` Interestingly, this also save space!

## bowtie2

The project home is [https://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio), whereby
```bash
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio/files/bowtie2/2.3.4.1/bowtie2-2.3.4.1-linux-x86_64.zip
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio/files/bowtie2/2.3.4.1/bowtie2-2.3.4.1-source.zip
unzip bowtie2-2.3.4.1-linux-x86_64.zip
cd bowtie2-2.3.4.1-linux-x86_64/
```
The test is then self-contained,
```bash
export BT2_HOME=/home/jhz22/D/genetics/bowtie2-2.3.4.1-linux-x86_64

$BT2_HOME/bowtie2-build $BT2_HOME/example/reference/lambda_virus.fa lambda_virus
$BT2_HOME/bowtie2 -x lambda_virus -U $BT2_HOME/example/reads/reads_1.fq -S eg1.sam
$BT2_HOME/bowtie2 -x $BT2_HOME/example/index/lambda_virus -1 $BT2_HOME/example/reads/reads_1.fq -2 $BT2_HOME/example/reads/reads_2.fq -S eg2.sam

samtools view -bS eg2.sam > eg2.bam
samtools sort eg2.bam -o eg2.sorted.bam
samtools mpileup -uf $BT2_HOME/example/reference/lambda_virus.fa eg2.sorted.bam | bcftools view -Ov - > eg2.raw.bcf
bcftools view eg2.raw.bcf
```
Like samtools, etc. it is possible to involve `sudo apt install bowtie2`.

## CNVkit

Genome-wide copy number from high-throughput sequencing, available from
[https://cnvkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://cnvkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## cutadapt, TrimGalore

A prerequesite is to install cython.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt
cd cutadapt
sudo python setup.py install
git clone https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore
```

## DeepVariant

It is a deep neural network to call genetic variants from next-generation DNA sequencing data, https://github.com/google/deepvariant.

## EasyQC

[http://www.niot.res.in/EasyQC/](http://www.niot.res.in/EasyQC/)

## Exomiser

```bash
git clone https://github.com/exomiser/Exomiser
cd Exomiser
mvn package
```
See also [https://github.com/exomiser/exomiser-demo](https://github.com/exomiser/exomiser-demo).

## fastq-splitter

The scripts divides a large FASTQ file into a set of smaller equally sized files, [http://kirill-kryukov.com/study/tools/fastq-splitter/](http://kirill-kryukov.com/study/tools/fastq-splitter/).

## fastx_toolkit, RSEM

It is also available from [https://github.com/agordon/fastx_toolkit](https://github.com/agordon/fastx_toolkit) along with [https://github.com/agordon/libgtextutils](https://github.com/agordon/libgtextutils), and do away with the notorious automake-1.14 problem associated with sources at http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/download.html.

However, line 105 of ```src/fasta_formatter/fasta_formatter.cpp``` requires ```usage()``` followed by ```exit(0);``` as suggested in the `issue` section. More oever, usage() is a void function so its own `exit(0)` is unnecessary.

The GitHub pages for RSEM are [https://github.com/deweylab/RSEM](https://github.com/deweylab/RSEM) and [https://deweylab.github.io/RSEM/](https://deweylab.github.io/RSEM/). It is also recommended that the Bioconductor package EBSeq be installed.

## freebayes

Try
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ekg/freebayes
make
sudo make install
```

## GATK

The source is available from https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/ but it is more convenient to use https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/releases/.
```bash
ln -s `pwd`/gatk $HOME/bin/gatk
gatk --help
gatk --list
```

## hisat2, sambamba, picard-tools, StringTie

Except StringTie, this is overlapped with ```apt install``` above,
```bash
brew tap brewsci/bio
brew tap brewsci/science
brew install hisat2
hisat2-build
brew install sambamba
brew install picard-tools
brew install stringtie
```
It could be useful with ``brew reinstall```. See
> Raghavachari N, Garcia-Reyero N (eds.) (2018), Gene Expression Analysis-Methods and Protocols, https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493978335, Chapter 15, Springer.

Nevertheless it may be slower, e.g., tophat, compared to ```sudo apt install```.

## IGV

The download can be seeded from http://data.broadinstitute.org/igv, e.g., http://data.broadinstitute.org/igv/projects/downloads/2.4/IGV_2.4.10.zip.

Again the source code is from GitHub, https://github.com/igvteam/igv/. For developers, [igv.js](https://github.com/igvteam/igv.js) is very appealing.

## Jannovar

From the GitHub repository, it is seen to use `project object model` (POM), an XML representation of a Maven project held in a file named `pom.xml`. We therefore install `maven` first,
```bash
sudo apt install maven
```
The installation then proceeds as follows,
```bash
git clone https://github.com/charite/jannovar
cd jannovar
mvn package
```
Other tasks such as compile, test, etc. are also possible.

It is handy to use symbolic link, i.e.,
```bash
ln -s /home/jhz22/D/genetics/jannovar/jannovar-cli/target/jannovar-cli-0.24.jar $HOME/bin/Jannovar.jar
java -jar $HOME/bin/Jannovar.jar db-list
java -jar $HOME/bin/Jannovar.jar download -d hg19/refseq
```
We may need to set memory size, e.g., 
```bash
java -Xms2G -Xmx4G -jar $HOME/bin/Jannovar.jar
```

# Melissa

https://github.com/andreaskapou/Melissa

> MEthyLation Inference for Single cell Analysis (Melissa), is a Bayesian hierarchical method to quantify spatially-varying methylation profiles across genomic regions from single-cell bisulfite sequencing data (scBS-seq). Melissa clusters individual cells based on local methylation patterns, enabling the discovery of epigenetic diversities and commonalities among individual cells. The clustering also acts as an effective regularisation method for imputation of methylation on unassayed CpG sites, enabling transfer of information between individual cells.

# pindel

The software can be obtained from https://github.com/genome/pindel.

After htslib is installed, the canonical instruction is to issue
```bash
git clone https://github.com/samtools/htslib
cd htslib
make
sudo make install
cd -
git clone https://github.com/genome/pindel
cd pindel
./INSTALL ../htslib
```
It is 'standard' to have complaints about pindel.cpp, bddate.cpp and genotyping.cpp,
for `abs()` rather than `fabs()` from the header file `cmath` have been used. The
issue goes away when `abs` is replaced with `fabs` and in the case of bddata.cpp,
it is also necessary to invoke the header, i.e.,
```cpp
#include <cmath>
```

## rtg-tools

It is available from https://www.realtimegenomics.com/products/rtg-tools and GitHub,
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RealTimeGenomics/rtg-tools.git
ant
dir dist
```

## sambamba

While the source contains ldc2, it is readily available with Ubuntu archive nevertheless failed to compile, 
so we proceed with instructions at the GitHub, e.g.,
```bash
export PATH=$HOME/ldc2-1.10.0-linux-x86_64/bin:$PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/ldc2-1.10.0-linux-x86_64/lib
```
for version 1.10.0.

## samtools

To build from source, we do these,
```bash
git clone https://github.com/samtools/htslib
cd htslib
make
cd -
git clone https://github.com/samtools/samtools
cd samtools
autoheader            # Build config.h.in (this may generate a warning about
                      # AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS - please ignore it).
autoconf -Wno-syntax  # Generate the configure script
./configure           # Needed for choosing optional functionality
make
make install
```
Note bgzip and tabix are distributed with htslib. It is relatively easier to install from release,
```bash
wget https://github.com/samtools/samtools/releases/download/1.9/samtools-1.9.tar.bz2
tar xjf samtools-1.9.tar.gz
cd samtools-1.9
./configure --prefix=/scratch/jhz22
make
make install
cd -
cd htslib-1.9
./configure --prefix=/scratch/jhz22
make
make install
```
where we install tabix as well.

## SnpEff, SnpSift, clinEff

It is straightforward with the compiled version from sourceforge, which also includes clinEff.
```bash
wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/snpEff_latest_core.zip
unzip snpEff_latest_core
cd snpEff
java -jar snpEff.jar databases
java -jar snpEff.jar download GRCh38.76
wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/databases/test_cases.tgz
tar fvxz test_cases.tgz
```
lists all the databases and download a particular one. Later, the test files are also downloaded and extracted.

The following steps compile from source instead.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pcingola/SnpEff.git
cd SnpEff
mvn package
mvn install
cd lib
# Antlr
mvn install:install-file \
	-Dfile=antlr-4.5.1-complete.jar \
	-DgroupId=org.antlr \
	-DartifactId=antlr \
	-Dversion=4.5.1 \
	-Dpackaging=jar

# BioJava core
mvn install:install-file \
	-Dfile=biojava3-core-3.0.7.jar \
	-DgroupId=org.biojava \
	-DartifactId=biojava3-core \
	-Dversion=3.0.7 \
	-Dpackaging=jar

# BioJava structure
mvn install:install-file \
	-Dfile=biojava3-structure-3.0.7.jar \
	-DgroupId=org.biojava \
	-DartifactId=biojava3-structure \
	-Dversion=3.0.7 \
	-Dpackaging=jar

cd -

# SnpSift
git clone https://github.com/pcingola/SnpSift.git
cd SnpSift
mvn package
mvn install
```
which gives `target/SnpEff-4.3.jar` and `target/SnpSift-4.3.jar`, respectively.

Note that `antlr4` is from GitHub, [https://github.com/antlr/antlr4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4). See also [https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/SnpEffWrapper](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/SnpEffWrapper).

```
or from the repository releases.

See [http://varscan.sourceforge.net/](http://varscan.sourceforge.net/) for further information.

## vcftools

Assuming that we use zlib 1.2.8 from module zlib/1.2.8, we can do the following,

```bash
wget https://github.com/vcftools/vcftools/releases/download/v0.1.16/vcftools-0.1.16.tar.gz
tar xvfz vcftools-0.1.16.tar.gz
module load zlib/1.2.8
./configure --prefix=/scratch/jhz22 ZLIB_CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/Cluster-Apps/zlib/1.2.8/include" ZLIB_LIBS="-L/usr/local/Cluster-Apps/zlib/1.2.8/lib -lz"
make
make install
```
To use vcf-concat, it is necessary to set the PERL5LIB environment variables, e.g.,
```bash
export PERL5LIB=/scratch/jhz22/share/perl5
```
