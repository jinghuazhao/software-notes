METASOFT

Meta-analysis software tool for genome-wide association studies that provides the following methods

   1.      Fixed Effects model (FE): Fixed effects model based on inverse-variance-weighted effect size.
   2.      Random Effects model (RE): Conventional random effects model based on inverse-variance-weighted effect size. Heterogeneity is estimated using DerSimonian-Laird method.
   3.      Han and Eskin's Random Effects model (RE2): Random effects model that increases power under heterogeneity.
   4.      Binary Effects model (BE): Random effects model assuming that the effects either exist or not in the studies.

Our software also provides the following information

   1.      M-values: M-value of a study is the estimated posterior probability that the effect exists in the study. M-value helps interpretation of the association results showing high heterogeneity.
